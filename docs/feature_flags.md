## Feature flags

`Feature flags` are represented as a 64-bit bitmask field in aistore cluster configuration denoting assorted (named) capabilities that can be individually enabled at runtime.

The features themselves are enumerated below. Not all feature flags - henceforth, "features" - are cluster-global.

Assorted features, denoted by `(*)` below, can also be changed on a per-bucket basis.

By default, all features are disabled, and the corresponding 64-bit field is set to zero.

## Tagging system

Feature flags are now organized with descriptive tags to help users understand their purpose and impact. The CLI displays features in a 3-column format: **FEATURE | TAGS | DESCRIPTION**.

### Tag categories

- **Domain-specific**: `s3`, `lz4`, `etl`, `mpu`, `telemetry`
- **Performance impact**: `perf`, `overhead`
- **Network/operations**: `net`, `ops`, `security`
- **Compatibility**: `compat`, `promote`

### Integrity impact indicators

Feature flags that affect data integrity are marked with directional indicators:

- **`integrity+`** - Enhances data integrity (safer, more conservative)
- **`integrity-`** - Potentially compromises data integrity (trading safety for performance)
- **`integrity?`** - Complex integrity implications (depends on deployment and runtime context)

This helps operators quickly identify flags that involve safety trade-offs.

## Validation and conflicts

Feature flags now include validation logic to prevent conflicting configurations:

- **`Disable-Cold-GET`** and **`Streaming-Cold-GET`** are mutually exclusive
- Additional validation rules may be added for other conflicting combinations

The validation occurs both at the cluster level and when setting bucket properties.

## Names and comments

| name | tags | comment |
| --- | --- | ------- |
| `Enforce-IntraCluster-Access` | `security` | when enabled, aistore targets will make sure _not_ to execute direct (ie., not redirected) API calls |
| `Skip-Loading-VersionChecksum-MD(*)` | `perf,integrity-` | skip loading existing object's metadata, Version and Checksum (VC) in particular |
| `Do-not-Auto-Detect-FileShare` | `promote,ops` | do not auto-detect file share (NFS, SMB) when _promoting_ shared files to AIS |
| `S3-API-via-Root` | `s3,compat,ops` | handle S3 requests via `aistore-hostname/` (whereby the default: `aistore-hostname/s3`) |
| `Fsync-PUT(*)` | `integrity+,overhead` | PUT and cold-GET: commit (or sync) the object payload to stable storage |
| `LZ4-Block-1MB` | `lz4` | .tar.lz4 format, lz4 compression: maximum uncompressed block size=1MB (default: 256K) |
| `LZ4-Frame-Checksum` | `lz4` | checksum lz4 frames |

| `S3-Presigned-Request(*)` | `s3,security,compat` | pass-through client-signed (presigned) S3 requests for subsequent authentication by S3 |
| `Do-not-Optimize-Listing-Virtual-Dirs` | `overhead` | when prefix doesn't end with '/' and is a subdirectory: don't assume there are no _prefixed_ object names |
| `Disable-Cold-GET` | `perf,integrity-` | do not perform [cold GET](/docs/overview.md#existing-datasets) request when using remote bucket |
| `Streaming-Cold-GET` | `perf,integrity-` | write and transmit cold-GET content back to user in parallel, without _finalizing_ in-cluster object |
| `S3-Reverse-Proxy` | `s3,net,ops` | use reverse proxy calls instead of HTTP-redirect for S3 API |
| `S3-Use-Path-Style` | `s3,compat` | use older path-style addressing (as opposed to virtual-hosted style), e.g., https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/KEY |
| `Do-not-Delete-When-Rebalancing` | `integrity?,ops` | disable lazy deletion during global rebalance: do not delete misplaced sources of the migrated objects |
| `Do-not-Set-Control-Plane-ToS` | `net,ops` | intra-cluster control plane: use default network priority (do not set IPv4 ToS to low-latency) |
| `Trust-Crypto-Safe-Checksums` | `integrity+,overhead` | when checking whether objects are identical trust only cryptographically secure checksums |
| `S3-ListObjectVersions` | `s3,overhead` | when versioning info is requested, use ListObjectVersions API (beware: extremely slow, versioned S3 buckets only) |
| `Enable-Detailed-Prom-Metrics` | `telemetry,overhead` | include (bucket, xaction) Prometheus variable labels with every GET and PUT transaction |
| `System-Reserved` | `ops` | system-reserved (do not set: the flag may be redefined or removed at any time) |
| `Resume-Interrupted-MPU` | `mpu,ops` | resume interrupted multipart uploads from persisted partial manifests |

> Notice the [FEATURE, TAGS, DESCRIPTION] table above that shows all supported feature flags along with their respective tags and descriptions. Currently selected features are shown in color. Tags help identify the purpose and impact of each feature at a glance.

> **Tip**: Use the tags to quickly identify features by category. For example, look for `integrity-` tags to identify features that may trade data integrity for performance, or `overhead` tags for features that may impact performance.

```

The same in JSON:

```console
$ ais config cluster features --json
{
    "features": "1552"
}
```

Finally, to reset feature flags back to the system defaults, `<TAB-TAB>` to select `none` from the completion list, or simply run:

```console
$ ais config cluster features none

PROPERTY         VALUE
features         none

Cluster config updated
```

## Bucket features

By default, created and added (ie., discovered upon remote lookup) buckets inherit their properties from the cluster.

> For background and details, see [Default Bucket Properties](/docs/bucket.md#default-bucket-properties).

It is possible, however, to change the defaults both at bucket creation time and/or at any later time.

Here's a brief 1-2-3 demonstration in re specifically: feature flags.

#### 1. show existing bucket-scope features

```console
$ ais bucket props set ais://nnn features <TAB-TAB>

Skip-Loading-VersionChecksum-MD   Disable-Cold-GET                  S3-ListObjectVersions
Fsync-PUT                         Streaming-Cold-GET                Resume-Interrupted-MPU
S3-Presigned-Request              S3-Use-Path-Style                 none
```

#### 2. select and set

```console
$ ais bucket props set ais://nnn features S3-Presigned-Request

"features" set to: "S3-Presigned-Request" (was: "none")

Bucket props successfully updated.

FEATURE                          TAGS                    DESCRIPTION
Skip-Loading-VersionChecksum-MD  perf,integrity-        (*) skip loading existing object's metadata, Version and Checksum (VC) in particular
Fsync-PUT                        integrity+,overhead    (*) when finalizing PUT(object): fflush prior to (close, rename) sequence
S3-Presigned-Request             s3,security,compat     (*) pass-through client-signed (presigned) S3 requests for subsequent authentication by S3   <<<<<< colored
Disable-Cold-GET                 perf,integrity-        disable cold-GET (from remote bucket)
Streaming-Cold-GET               perf,integrity-        write and transmit cold-GET content back to user in parallel, without _finalizing_ in-cluster object
S3-Use-Path-Style                s3,compat              use older path-style addressing (as opposed to virtual-hosted style), e.g., https://s3.amazonaws.com/BUCKET/KEY
```

#### 3. reset feature flags back to zero (or 'none')

```console
$ ais bucket props set ais://nnn features none
"features" set to: "0" (was: "S3-Presigned-Request")

Bucket props successfully updated.

S3-ListObjectVersions            s3,overhead            when versioning info is requested, use ListObjectVersions API (beware: extremely slow, versioned S3 buckets only)
```

### Validation errors

When setting conflicting feature flags, the system will reject the configuration - e.g.:

```console
$ ais config cluster features Disable-Cold-GET Streaming-Cold-GET

Error: feature flags "Disable-Cold-GET" and "Streaming-Cold-GET" are mutually exclusive
```
